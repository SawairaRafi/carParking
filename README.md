# carParking
This Project is implemented on Hardware i.e FPGA (EP4CE115F29C7) and Software implementation is on Quartus using VHDL. 
The goal of this project is to make a ‘CAR PARKING SYSTEM’ and an opportunity to avoid manual car parking. This project will help to detect the available parking slot according to the type of vehicle and user will have access to the slot. This project need to design a parking system and slot as well as how to park the car automatically without any problem and simulate the code to ensure that the code is working or not using VHDL. This project ensure a safe and secured parking system to assign the right way and minimizes the waste of time for trying to find out free parking space.  

The objectives are below:
▪ To implement the FSM of an intelligent car parking system on software based.
▪ To introduce automatic car parking system in our country and get benefits from it 
▪ To ensure safety while park the car. 
▪ Park car without guided by park attendance. 
▪ Park car without wastage of time.
